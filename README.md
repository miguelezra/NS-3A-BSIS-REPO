Web Development Class
THIS IS THE FINALIZED PROJECT AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS, I HAVE FINALLY GET THE FORMAT AND SEQUENCE OF CREATING A WEBSITE PORTFOLIO. 
I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT PORTFOLIO FORMATS THAT ARE UNIQUE BUT I STILL LACK THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE AND EXECUTE THE CODE PROPERLY. 
OVERALL, IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS HARD FOR ME (it was my fault lol).
I HOPE TO DO MORE ACTIVITIES LIKE THIS TO HONE MY SKILLS AND ANALYZATION OF THE CODE IN THE FUTURE.
